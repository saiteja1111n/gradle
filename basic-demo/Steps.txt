Initialize a project
1. create new directory
2. execute 'gradle init' in the new directory. This creates new project with necessary directories.
Directory structure:
+-- build.gradle  
+-- gradle
¦   +-- wrapper
¦       +-- gradle-wrapper.jar  
¦       +-- gradle-wrapper.properties  
+-- gradlew  
+-- gradlew.bat  
+-- settings.gradle  


Create task
Explaination with example -
To copy data from 'src' folder to 'dest' folder. Add the following to build.gradle 

task copy(type: Copy, group: "Custom", description: "Copies sources to the dest directory") {
    from "src"
    into "dest"
}


Apply a plugin

add plugins to build.gradle as follows. The below added plugin is 'base', which has zip that we are using for running zip task.
plugins {
    id "base"
}

task zip(type: Zip, group: "Archive", description: "Archives sources in a zip file") {
    from "src"
    setArchiveName "basic-demo-1.0.zip"
}
Note: Adding tasks before plugins will endup in errors. So create tasks after plugins.
